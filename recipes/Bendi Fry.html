	<p> Bhendi Fry (alternately called Okra fry, Bhindi fry, Bhindi masala or Bharwan bhindi) is stir fried okra (ladies' finger) that is slit and stuffed with spice mix such as garam masala and other locally available ground spices. This dish is stir-fried or saut√©ed slightly, which is distinct from batter-fried okra, which involves deep frying. It can be served as a side dish in accompaniment with steamed rice and dal or with chapati as a form of sabzi.</p>
